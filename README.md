# Welcome to Processing.js 5

This repository contains **getting-started programming examples** that demonstrate graphics and animation concepts using **p5.js**, the modern successor to Processing.js, for use in standard web pages.

The goal of this repo is to provide **simple, incremental examples** that are easy to explore, modify, and build upon.

---

## Getting Started

All example sketches live in the folder:

00_Getting_Started/


Each example consists of:
- an `.html` file (the sketch entry point)
- a matching `.js` file (the sketch logic)

You can open the **main index page** to browse all examples:

👉 **[Open the index.html](index.html)**


> ⚠️ Because modern browsers restrict local file access, you cannot view directly off GitHub. However once you download the folder you should be set up to begin viewing and developing locally.

## Empty Template Folder

The **empty template folder** included in this repository is the basic blank canvas that comes with the official p5.js download.

It serves as a clean starting point for creating new sketches from scratch.

## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is intended for:
- beginners learning creative coding
- educators creating structured lesson material
- experimentation and reference

All examples are kept **deliberately simple** to emphasize core concepts such as:
- coordinates
- motion
- input
- transforms
- images
- text
- animation loops
